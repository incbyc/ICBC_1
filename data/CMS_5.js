Eswatini has one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world, which has resulted in many orphaned or vulnerable children living on the streets without any hope for the future. CMS has a vision to make a difference in Eswatini for many generations through the care of orphaned and vulnerable children, development of rural communities, education, rehabilitation programs, rural healthcare, sustainability projects and teaching godly leadership." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 31.150464, -26.3551912 ] } }
